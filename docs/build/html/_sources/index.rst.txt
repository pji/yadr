Introduction to :mod:`yadr`
===========================
The :mod:`yadr` package is a Yet Another Dice Notation (YADN) parser
that can be used to generate random numbers in a way that simulates
rolling dice for a game.

The name :dfn:`yadr` stands for "Yet Another Dice Roller," a reference
to the fact there is no shortage of dice rollers in PyPI.


.. _using:

Using :mod:`yadr`
=================
If you want to execute the package from the command line, you can
install the package using :mod:`pip` or other Python package manager, and
run it as a module with the following::

    python -m yadr <YADN_string>

If you want to import it into your own code, install and import the
package as usual. You can then use the :func:`yadr.roll()` function
to execute a string of YADN.::

    >>> import yadr
    >>>
    >>> yadn = '3d6'
    >>> result = yadr.roll(yadn)
